> OpenLRS has been superceded by OpenLRW which provides similar functionality to OpenLRS in terms of event storage in standards-based formats but adds the capability to store additional data that is needed in support of events such as users, classes and enrollments.
All new development will occur in OpenLRW. If you are interested in a standards-based learning record store we encourage you to check out OpenLRW.
